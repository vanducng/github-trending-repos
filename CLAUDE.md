# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project called "trending-repos" that appears to be in early development. The project uses Python 3.13+ and follows modern Python packaging standards with pyproject.toml.

## Development Commands

- **Run the application**: `python main.py`
- **Install dependencies**: `pip install -e .` (when dependencies are added)

## Project Structure

The project currently has a minimal structure:
- `main.py`: Entry point with a simple hello world function
- `pyproject.toml`: Python project configuration
- `README.md`: Currently empty

This appears to be a freshly initialized project template ready for development of GitHub trending repositories functionality.
